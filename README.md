## Lifestyle
Hi, I am Sirish Gambhira. I am a pre-final year undergrad from E & ECE Dept, IIT Kharagpur. I am from Kurnool (AndhraPradesh, India), which is famous for Konda Reddy Fort. I enjoy playing games, watching TV series, and generally code in my leisure time. I recently started learning piano and became quite comfortable with it. Since October, I started workouts, and I am trying to cutdown the body fat. So if are a fun-lover, or just need to chat, feel free to reach out. Peace.

## Work

I am interested in Machine Learning and worked on a few projects. During my 3rd year winter vacation, I worked as a research intern at CVIT Lab, IIIT Hyderabad. The objective of the project is to classify the actions learnt from skeletal reprsentations. My task was to imrpove the current model performance by adding new hierarchical architectures. I implemented Network of Experts, a hierarchical architecure on VA-CNN model. I learny pytorch, improved my python skills, and got my first research exposure.
