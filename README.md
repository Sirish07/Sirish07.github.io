## Lifestyle
Hi, I am Sirish Gambhira. I am a pre-final year undergrad from E & ECE Dept, IIT Kharagpur. I am from Kurnool (AndhraPradesh, India), which is famous for a historical fort. I enjoy playing games, watching TV series, and code in my leisure time. I recently started learning piano and became quite comfortable with it. Since October, I started workouts, and I am trying to cutdown the body fat. So if are a fun-lover, or just need to talk, feel free to reach out. Peace.

## Work

I am interested in Machine Learning and worked on a few projects. During my 2nd year, I worked as a research intern at CVIT Lab, IIIT Hyderabad. I learnt basics of computer vision and worked on implementation of deep-neural network architectures.
